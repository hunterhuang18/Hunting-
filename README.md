# Machine Learning Learning-
This is a repository recording my study of Machine Learning. In this brand, I will combine the the solutions from Udemy course "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" and Coursera course "Machine Learning Specilization" to some small projects. Solutions do not include details of the algorithm, but I will try to include some methods of cleaning and visualizing the data. These dataets of the projects may come from the courses or Kaggle. The progress is based on the chapters of these two courses.
